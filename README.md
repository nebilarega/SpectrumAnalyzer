### 2. It show the I/Q signals received with the antenna as consetellation plots.
### 3. It shows the spectrogram plot of the comming I/Q signals.


### This project is done using Qt framework and C++. The project was motivated by a simple project done here, https://github.com/orhun/rtl_map.
### This project adds the functionality of spectrogram. It also uses multithreading to combat the blocking code found in the rtlsdr library.
